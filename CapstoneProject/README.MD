# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Scope of Works
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various skills associated with data engineering projects. In particular, developing simple ETL pipelines jupyter notebook and standard python file, constructing data warehouses through Redshift databases and S3 data storage as well as defining efficient data models e.g. star schema. As an example I will perform a deep dive into US immigration, primarily focusing fiding out where immigrations are coming from.
